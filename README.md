# Information

Uisual is a collection of free landing page templates designed by Indonesian designer, [El Nino](https://github.com/elnino). There's no JS, only plain HTML and CSS. I'm creating Uisual as a portfolio to get a job, whether it's freelance, part-time, full-time, or contract. If you're interested in hiring me, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:elnino@uisual.com).

## How to Use

It's plain HTML and CSS really. You don't need to install or learn any frameworks. As long as you know how to edit HTML and CSS, you can start customizing our templates right away. We made our templates black and white for a reason, so you can customize them the way you want more easily. Think of it as a wireframe. Change the images, copy, typefaces, etc. Add some background colors, gradients, box shadows, etc. We use CSS variables of course.

## Questions Answered

#### Why are your templates so bland?

Think of it as a wireframe. It's black and white because we want you to customize it yourself. You need some creativity to combine colors, typefaces, box shadows, etc. Play around, make it yours.

#### Are your templates responsive?

Yes, we designed our templates responsively (320px, 768px, 1024px, and 1200px).

#### Can I sell products with your templates?

Yes, you can sell apps, ebooks, extensions, etc.

#### Do I need to credit you?

No, but that would be cool.
